# This is a derived branch mainly updated by Liam

## Project made for the Trophee of NSI

On this project, we have currently 3 people,
One Artist, 2 coders.

Vix = Artist (who will make most if not all the artwork)  
Stormy = Coder  
Me = Coder  


# Why derived to another branch

The reasons are multiple, but in short, the normal project is limited by things we learn in NSI class. However I wanted to go further than the limitation, thus made that branch to seek what I could do best.
Featuring a dynamic UI that, may or may not be outer scope of the project.
Moreover, this branch is mainly for test purposes.
