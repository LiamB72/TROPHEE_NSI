# Project made for the Trophee of NSI

On this project, we have currently 3 people,
One Artist, 2 coders.

Vix/Lucy/Lucyfer = Artist  
Greeves0/StormyComputer = Coder  
LiamB = Coder  

# Requirements

If you wish to execute the code on itself, please execute the main.py.
Moreover, you will need at least PyQT6 and pyqt-tools.

-> In a cmd: python -m pip.exe install pyqt6 pyqt-tools

However, in the near futur, if not already the case, I'll release a version with an executable.
